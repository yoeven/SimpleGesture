<h1 id="simplegesture">SimpleGesture</h1>
<p>Simple Gesture is a unity touch library that allows you to easily implement touch controls. This package was on the Asset store for free but it’s no longer available for some reason. I took to liberty to create a unity package from one of my old games that I used this library for. To be clear, this library doesn’t belong to me, just making it easy for you guys to download and use it.</p>
